Console-based veterinary management system using Java and OOP principles

# Veterinary Management System

This is a simple Java project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
The system allows users to manage clients and appointments for a veterinary clinic through a console-based interface.  
The project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Features
- User registration and login
- Client registration, selection, and listing
- Appointment scheduling
- Reservation management
- Console-based UI for easy navigation
- Organized into logical layers: UI, Logic Layer, and User Controller

## Technologies
- Java (Console Application)
- IntelliJ IDEA (Development Environment)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Project Structure
- `/CapaInterfazGrafica/` → Handles the console-based user interface
- `/CapaLogica/` → Business logic and data classes
- `/Controladores/` → User controls

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.
2. Compile all Java files.
3. Run the main application through the console.
4. Register a new user, log in, and start managing clients and appointments.

## Purpose
I built this project, however, although it is not a very complicated project, it was quite useful for me as a way to practice what I saw in my OOP course. 
I am happy with how it turned out and I hope you like it.
